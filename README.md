# NixOS Dotfiles

### About

This idea came at a time when conventional linux systems no longer met my own needs.
So from a friend, I ended up discovering **NixOS**, this very dynamic and well-structured platform.

This repository was created with the intention of storing my systems configurations from these "Dotfiles".
All content that is here can be used by anyone.
Special thanks to @abehidek ❤️.
